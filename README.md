# character-tooltips
A Tampermonkey script which displays tooltip hints for a predefined list of characters when they show up on a website.

You can get a better picture of what it does [here](https://charactertooltips.000webhostapp.com/) where the script is used to provide pronunciation help for Japanese katakana and hiragana characters.
